# Cypress practice
Just a [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) tool practice

## How to use
1. `npx cypress open`
2. Find you test spec and open it

## Notes
I've really enjoyed using Cypress as an automation tool because it has a really impression functionality. You can write tests, find locators and visually debug it at the same time. Impressive!
